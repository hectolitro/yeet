## Usage

Using Yeet is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can manage your services:

### Starting a Service

To start a service, use the following command:

```

### Stopping a Service

```

## Networking Options

Yeet offers flexible networking options to suit your deployment needs:

### Tailscale

Tailscale simplifies secure networking. It creates a mesh VPN that allows your devices to connect directly. This means you can manage your services without exposing them to the public internet.

### Macvlan

Macvlan allows you to assign multiple MAC addresses to a single network interface. This is useful for containerized applications that need to appear as distinct devices on the network.
